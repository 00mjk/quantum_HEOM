## Using these files

* The files in this folder can be used to reproduce the figures found in the author's Master's thesis. 

* The numbers at the start of the filenames correspond to the number of the Figure they reproduce (i.e. '2.2_...' corresponds to Figure 2.2). 

* For each filename there exists a '.pdf' file, which is the figure itself, and a '.txt' file that contains 'Python-copyable code' that can be copied into a jupyter notebook cell and run to reproduce the figure. 

* Different named files for a given numbered Figure correspond to different sub-figures that may comprise an overall Figure in the thesis.

* Follow the [tutorial for reproducing figures](https://github.com/jwa7/quantum_HEOM/blob/master/doc/tutorials/0_reproducing_figures.ipynb) to see an example.
